# System School Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **System School** Project! This project is developed in C++ and designed to automate and manage various school-related operations, including student records, course registration, and academic performance tracking. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle school management tasks, streamlining the process of managing student data, course enrollments, and academic performance.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, view, update, and delete student profiles.
- **Course Registration**: Enroll students in available courses and manage their registrations.
- **Academic Records**: Track and display grades and performance data for students.
- **User Interface**: A simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all user inputs are properly validated and formatted to avoid errors and inconsistencies.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language for building the application.
- **OOP Principles**: Utilized Object-Oriented Programming concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to design the system in a modular and maintainable way.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Used for efficient data handling with containers such as vectors, strings, and maps.
